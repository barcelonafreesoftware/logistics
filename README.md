# This repository contains information about BFS Meetup logistics

## Posters
To generate a talk poster, use the generaposter.py script as follows:

```bash
generaposter.py "Title" "PresenterName" "Date" "Address"
```
For example:

```bash
generaposter.py "Liberating acoustic metadata: AcousticBrainz and Essentia" "Robert Kaye (@MayhemBCN) &amp; Xavier Serra (@mtg_upf)" "26th February, 19h" "Trovit Search Av. Diagonal 601, 9th floor"
```
It generates a poster.pdf file in the current directory.

### Requirements
The `generaposter.py` script needs python3 and Inkscape.

You also need to have the following fonts in your system:

- [Hipster Script Pro](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/hipster-script-pro/)
- [Oxygen](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oxygen)

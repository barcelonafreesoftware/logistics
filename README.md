## Posters
To generate a talk poster, use the generaposter.py script as follows:
    ```python
    generaposter.py "Title" "PresenterName" "Date" "Address"
    ```
For example:
    ```python
    generaposter.py "Liberating acoustic metadata: AcousticBrainz and Essentia" "Robert Kaye (@MayhemBCN) &amp; Xavier Serra (@mtg_upf)" "26th February, 19h" "Trovit Search Av. Diagonal 601, 9th floor"
    ``
It generates a poster.pdf file in the current directory.

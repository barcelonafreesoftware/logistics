# Barcelona Free Software, sponsorship opportunities
The Barcelona Free Software group organizes presentations and discussions about Free and Open Source software in Barcelona. Our main mission is to gather and enrich the flourishing technology community in the area.
We do this by making sure that projects have a channel to explain what they do and by facilitating the encounter with possible new collaborators. This happens in a relaxed atmosphere where problems get to be solved and connections can be made.

To make sure the group is sustainable, we've set up the following sponsorship program, with two levels of sponsorship.

### Collaborator
